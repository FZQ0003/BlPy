A series of blender python scripts by F_Qilin.

To be honest, I don't know whether I can continue...

**Attention: Some of the files may be written in Chinese.**

## Script List

* Extrude for Voxels (v1.2.2)

## How to use

### Run a script directly

Open the script in blender text editor, then click "Run Script".

### Run a script using command

If you run the command below, you should **first add blender installation path to PATH.**

```commandline
blender -P script.py
```

You can also create "*.ink" file.
